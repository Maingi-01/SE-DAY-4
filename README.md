3.Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile
- Iterative and flexible
- allows changes
- Best for mutable changes
- Continuous releases
- ongoing.

Waterfall
- Sequential and structured
- Changes are difficult
- Best for well-defined projects
- single final release
- liited to my milestones

4.In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is ideal for dynamic prjects like web aplication development and startups where requirements happen frequently. Example is Mobile app develpoment.

Waterfall is suitable for projects with fixed requirements, such as bankig software. Example: Banking software.

5.What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Quality assurance methods are such as: Automated testing, code reviews, user testing, performance testing, documentation and standards.
Maintaing high standards improves software reliability, security, and user satisfaction.

6.How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Defining the project scope helps set clear goals and avoid unnecessary work. A WBS is a hierarchial decomposition of tasks, making complex projects more manageable.
